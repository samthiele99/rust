//Varibales hold primitive data or references to data
// Variables are immutable buy default
// Rust is a block-scoped language, set a variable in function it stays there

pub fn run() {
    let name = "Sam"

    age = 38

    // Define constant, need type

    const ID: int32 = 001;

    // can assign multiple variables at once

    let ( my_name, my_age) = ("Sam", 22);
